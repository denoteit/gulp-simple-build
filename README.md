# Ready, set, gulp!

This is a simple framework for using gulp, giving the basic setup for a web project. Download the repo, then in the local directory...

```
npm install --save-dev
```

And then after that's finished, for some reason (a bug) I need to do this to make the minification work with /dist/...

```
npm install gulp-cssnano
```

And that's it!
